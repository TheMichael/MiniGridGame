# AI Agent Galaxy 🚀

A web-based game where you predict how many steps AI agents can take to complete MiniGrid challenges. Test your intuition against Deep Q-Learning and Double Deep Q-Learning agents!

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd MiniGridGame
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd backend
python app.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000`
```for demonstration purposes, run python populate_db.py```

## Features

- 🤖 **Multiple AI Agents**: DDQN and D3QN reinforcement learning agents
- 🎯 **Prediction Game**: Guess how many steps agents will take
- 📊 **Risk Zones**: Different difficulty levels with varying scoring multipliers
- 🎬 **Visual Replays**: Watch AI agents navigate the grid in real-time
- 👥 **User Accounts**: Track your progress and compete with others
- 🏆 **Scoring System**: Earn points based on prediction accuracy and risk level

## Game Rules

### Prediction Zones

- **🟢 Safe Zone (51-80 steps)**: Low risk, standard scoring
- **🟡 Probable Zone (21-50 steps)**: Medium risk, slight bonus
- **🟠 Struggle Zone (81-100 steps)**: High risk, good bonus
- **🔴 Failure Zone (101-120 steps)**: Very high risk, excellent bonus
- **⚫ Impossible Zone (0-20 steps)**: Extreme risk, maximum bonus
- **❌ Failure Prediction (0 steps)**: Predict the agent will fail completely

### Scoring

Points are awarded based on:
- **Accuracy**: How close your prediction was to the actual result
- **Risk Level**: Higher risk zones give bonus multipliers
- **Success Prediction**: Correctly predicting success vs failure
